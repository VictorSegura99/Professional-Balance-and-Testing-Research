# Difference Between QA and QC
QA(Quality Assurance)  and QC(Quality Control) are two different things, although QC usually is a part of QA.

QA is the whole proactive process addressed to help our videogames to reach the quality we expect from them. It makes sure we do the right things in the right way.
QC is the testing processes make when the product is complete(in the case of video games, every build would count), that have the quality we planned and, if it’s not the case, stop the production to fix this problems.

So, the difference is clear, QA is centered in the process to assure the quality, while QC is centered in control that the quality it’s what we aimed.

The difference between QA and QC is largely one of power and control. QC is usually as service provided to development and is responsible for providing that service. QA expects development to provide services to it and is not responsible for any result.

# Professional Videogame Balance Methods:

Videogame Balance is obviously very important, but there’s not a flawless way to accomplish this, and lot of times come to designers guessing. To avoid this, there’s methods to try to getting as close as possible to a balanced game.

**Power curve**

This method solves the problem of different elements affecting the same thing.
In this method, it’s all about have similar effect per investment ratio. This means that the first step would be identify what have to invest the player in our games. (TODO 1?)
After this, we should measure what effect have each element we should consider in order to balance our game. For example, in an action game, could be damage, movement, etc.
With this, we can make a graphic and see all the different elements and how they scale with the investment. For example, with weapons we can measure DPS(damage per second).



**Triple Tapping**

The most probable is that on our first iteration, the game will be still very unbalanced, so following the method above, we would re estimate the cost or the power of the element at where it should be, right?
Actually, you’ll probably keep the element in the wrong state in the same direction. What expert developers advice is to over change the direction to triangulate the actual ideal cost and each iteration be closer.
To put it on an example: if a weapon doing 300 DPS is overpowered by a lot, don’t put the damage per second in 250 if you think it will be correct, because probably will still be overpowered and you’ll not gain much information. Put it on 200 or even 150, where the weapon should be under powered, but now you have completely correct margins to work with.

**How our players see the game**

The most powerful tool designers have to balance their game is their proper players. 
In order to balance some aspect of our game, it’s correct to ask to our players, in our particular case, during the playtests. As the Termi Law says, an average of a lot of not close estimations by different people will result on a very exact estimation of the ideal result, so if we ask a lot of players, even if they don’t have a great knowledge of the game, and do an average of their estimations, we’ll be closer to a perfect estimation of how the perfect balance would be.
