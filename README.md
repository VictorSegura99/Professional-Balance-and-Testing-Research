## The main problem
Usually, at low professional levels, QA and testing are pretty chaotic and inefficient processes that could be a lot more useful and productive having a few things in mind.

## Difference Between QA and QC
QA(Quality Assurance)  and QC(Quality Control) are two different things, although QC is a part of QA.

QA is the whole proactive process addressed to help our videogames to reach the quality we expect from them. It makes sure we do the right things in the right way.
QC is the testing processes make when the product is complete(in the case of video games, every build would count), that have the quality we planned and, if it’s not the case, stop the production to fix this problems.

So, the difference is clear, QA is centered in the process to assure the quality, while QC is centered in control that the quality it’s what we aimed.

The difference between QA and QC is largely one of power and control. QC is usually as service provided to development and is responsible for providing that service. QA expects development to provide services to it and is not responsible for any result.

## How do companies organize testing?

**Roles:**

_Producers_: they work with the marketing and quality assurance team to organize test and to establish deadlines.

_QA/test lead_: manages QA staff. Responsible of bug lists. Tracks bug reports and ensures they’re fixed. Coordinates all QA teams. They are usually responsible of submitting to regulatory bodies such as ESRB and PEGI.

_Testers_: they write accurate reports on bugs, and ensure that the game is fun and works correctly.

_SDET(Software Development Engineer in Test)_: they test game performance and security. They are usually experts in computer science rather than in video games.

**Testing process:**

Identification: find the bug.

Reporting: the bug is reported to the developers in an accurate report which includes how to reproduce the bug and priority.

Analysis: Developer in charge of the area in which the bug has appeared checks the malfunction.

Verification: the testers check that the bug has been fixed.

**6 Steps:**

  1. Plan and outline the test.

  2. Set up the test.

  3. Play out the test.

  4. Report the outcomes.

  5. Repair the bug.

  6. Come back to 1 and retest.

**Factors:**

Bug Tracking Framework: Each time a bug is discovered the game tester needs to make another object of some sort (or “ticket”) in a bug tracking system.

Test Case: Establish what your are going to test and how. It should have a description, steps and finally an expected outcome.

Test Suite: a test suite or checklist is a collection of Test Cases set up together on account of a particular objective. This objective needs to do with approval of the game’s localization (translation of content and voice), physic engine, and so forth.

Aptitudes, Experience and Thoroughness: To be a committed game tester, one needs to utilize these aptitudes legitimately, have the capacity to write relating test cases, sort out steady test suites and make precisely clear bug records.

**What do game testers do?**

Figure out how to be monotonous and also startling. Fundamentally, you’re attempting to break the game.

Test distinctive adaptions of the games including console and computer versions if accessible.

Focus on specific territories of the game and attempt each probability available.

Play games utilizing distinctive settings and alternatives if accessible.

Check for grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and language.

Proof some other documentation with the game including manuals, directions, and different booklets.

Report any error code that may pop up as well as reporting them to bug tracking system.

Comprehend the contrast between revealing a bug and reporting a component.

Play and test the game over and over again in various ways and conditions.

Analyze new versions of the game and repeat earlier bugs to check whether they have been settled.

**Types of testing:**

The tests can be done automatically, where they are previously programed to run certain case scenarios and search for bugs, memory leaks, crashes… or they can be done manually, with a tester in front of the screen playing the game.

Functionality: generic test that searches for stability issues, mechanics issues, and game asset integrity.

Compliance: test that checks technical requirements in different platforms. Also ESRB and PEGI rating.

Compatibility: test to ensure that the game works fine with different combinations of hardware and software in PC.

Localization: testers make sure that the game is well translated in their own language and there aren’t any mistakes in the text edition part.

Soak: leaving the game for a prolonged period of time in different screens and actions. Checks for crashes and memory leaks.

Alpha and Beta: tests performed during the alpha and beta stages of the game. It can be done with testers from the company or it can be a public beta, where the players are the testers. It is a global check.

Regression: test performed when a bug has been fixed in order to ensure that it has definitely been solved and it hasn’t produced other ugs.

Load/Stress: test how much load of something the game is able to support, for example: active sprites in screen, players in mmo games, number of particles, polygons…

Multiplayer: testers ensure that all connectivity methods (modem, LAN, Internet) are working.

Mobile game: includes many of the previous test, but now in a mobile phone platform.

**Bug reports format:**

Part 1: Title and overview
Overview of what, where, why, when and how the bug is generated and how does it affect the game.

Part 2: Classification
In depth analysis of the characteristics of the bug and some contemplations. Here you have to put everything regarding the bug. You also classify the bug depending on how it affects the game and its priority compared to other bugs.

Part 3: Generation
A comprehensive and easy to understand guide on how to replicate the bug.

Part 4: Extra information
Any data you think would be useful regarding the bug, you put it in here. You can also write your opinion on how to solve the issue.

## Professional Videogame Balance Methods:

Videogame Balance is obviously very important, but sometimes define what a balanced game is not easy.

The best definition for us is "_Game Balance is creating the APPEREANCE of fairness in a game_", by Ian Schreiber, 2017.

The word appereance is very important, because for the sake of achieving the best experience possible for the player, fairness it's not always the way.

There’s not a flawless way to accomplish a perfectly balanced game, so the previous experience and knowledge of the designers play a big role in this. To support and help this assumptions, there’s different useful methods.

**Progression Curves**

The core use of this method it's to create graphic curves and compare them in order to see how they interact with each other and see the actual state in every moment.
This method is very wide and have lots of applications, so we are going to explain the more important ones.

The first application is Power Curves.
In this application, we can see how every effect compares to the others with similar investment. It's very useful because we can see clearly if something has more great effect per investment ratio.

For example, in a game with weapons, we could compare them with the Damage Per Second, Damage Per Range, etc.
The main problem with this application is that it lefts out elements that we should have in mind. This can be fixed comparing lots of graphics for every element, but it's not very efficient.

The second application is progression curves themselves.
In this application we see how an specific element evolves over time. This is very useful because you can compare two big elements and clearly see how they interact. Above all, this can help a lot to see the Game Flow when comparing elements that affect this very directly.

For example, if we compare how the player's damage is scaling over time with the health of the enemies, we'll see how great the challenge would be. Or in a case more independent from the player's hability, in an RPG we could see how the money the player obtains compares with the cost of the objects of his level.


**Triple Tapping**

This method it's a trying method. The theory behind it consist in establishing margins to work with in order to get closer every iteration to the perfect balance.
In order to do that, we should consider that when changing a value because it's not balanced, we should change the number in a excessive way, in order to establish a margin in the opposite state.

To put it on an example: if a weapon doing 300 DPS is overpowered by a lot, don’t put the damage per second in 250 if you think it will be correct, because probably will still be overpowered and you’ll not gain much information. Put it on 200 or even 150, where the weapon should be under powered, but now you have established correct margins to work with.

**Testing and Analytics**

The most powerful tool designers have to balance their game is their proper players. 

Another method is to create variables inside the code that will save in the playtests. After the playtests, we should revise the data collected to see what elements of the game are unbalanced and, in combination with the other methods explained, come to a closer to balanced value.

![image](https://github.com/VictorSegura99/Professional-Balance-and-Testing-Research/blob/master/docs/top-7-data-analytics-tools-2019.jpg?raw=true)

In order to balance some aspect of our game, it’s correct to ask to our players, in our particular case, during the playtests. Even if players don't have the exact idea of our game or all the correct knowledge to think a correct value. the Termi Law says that an average of a lot of not close estimations by different people will result on a very exact estimation of the ideal result, so if we ask a lot of players,  and do an average of their estimations, we’ll be closer to a perfect estimation of how the perfect balance would be.
